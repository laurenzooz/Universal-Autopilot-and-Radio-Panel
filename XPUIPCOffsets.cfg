# XPUIPCOffsets.cfg - XPUIPC offset configuration file
#
# This file configures the mapping between X-Plane datarefs and FSUIPC offsets.
# It consists of a series of Command, Dataref and Offset commands, which can
# appear in any order. Commands are separated by line breaks by default (i.e.
# each one has to appear on its own line), but can be continued on the next line
# with the underscore (_) as the last non-blank character. Each command has a
# number of parameters, which are separated by any amount of white space (blank,
# tab). If not specifically stated otherwise, case is significant. Everything
# beyond a # sign is considered a comment and is ignored, as are blank lines. 
#
#
# Dataref <identifier> <dataref name> <type>
#
# Dataref commands assign a dataref to a unique identifier, and specify the type
# of the dataref. The dataref name is the unique string that identifies the
# dataref within X-Plane. Valid types are: int, float, and double for scalars,
# and intarray, floatarray, and data for arrays. If the dataref is an array,
# the array index in square brackets is appended to the dataref name, like this:
#
# Dataref	eng1_mixt	sim/flightmodel/engine/ENGN_mixt[0]		floatarray
#
#
# Offset <number> <type> <priority> <access> <conversion expression>
# 
# Offset commands specify how the value that can be read from an offset is to be
# calculated from any number of datarefs, and/or how to calculate values for
# any number of datarefs from the value written to an offset. The offset's
# number should be given in the usual hexadecimal notation, with leading 0x.
# For digits beyond 9, lower-case and upper-case letters are supported. Valid
# types are: UINT8, UINT16, UINT32, UINT64 for unsigned integers of various
# widths, SINT8, SINT16, SINT32, SINT64 for signed integers, and FLOAT32,
# FLOAT64 for floating point values. The priority determines how often the
# offset is updated from its corresponding dataref(s). Valid values are:
# 1		every flight model frame
# 2		every 7th frame		
# 3		every 13th frame
# 4		every 31st frame
# 5		every 31st frame, but phase-shifted by 500 ms
# 6		every 59th frame
# 7		every 157th frame
# 8		every 313th frame
# Access mode is one of r, w, or rw, to enable read, write, or read and write
# access, respectively. All remaining parameters, up to a maximum of 256, make
# up the conversion expression, which is explained below. Example:
#
# Offset	0x0890	UINT16	4	rw	$eng1_mixt 16384 * >eng1_mixt @ 16384 /
#
# Note that this is one of the vast number of offsets hard-coded into XPUIPC.
# As offset configured here take precedence over built-in ones, you can override
# the latter with your own implementation if you don't like the default. You can
# even completely disable built-in offsets by giving an Offset command with no
# conversion expression at all (not sure why you'd want to do that, though).
#
#
# Command <offset number> <offset type> [<toggle> <value> <command name>] [...]
#
# Command commands let you trigger actions within X-Plane - anything that can be
# assigned to joystick or keyboard buttons - from offset writes. The offset's
# number and type are specified just like in an Offset command. The remaining
# parameter triple, which can appear more than once, specifies which command
# to trigger when a specific value is written to the offset. Commands come in
# two varieties: toggle commands, meant to be fired momentarily, and continuous
# commands, meant to be 'held down'. If the toggle parameter is 1, the command
# is 'clicked' whenever the offset changes to the given value, i.e fired once.
# If the toggle parameter is 0, the command is 'held down' as long as the
# offset has the given value, i.e. fired continuously until the offset changes
# to a different value. For example, the magneto/ignition switch for the no. 1
# engine can be implemented like this:
#
# Command	0x0892	UINT16	1	0	sim/magnetos/magnetos_off_1 _
#							1	1	sim/magnetos/magnetos_right_1 _
#							1	2	sim/magnetos/magnetos_left_1 _
#							1	3	sim/magnetos/magnetos_both_1 _
#							0	4	sim/starters/engage_starter_1
#
# Note that you can use the same offset in a Command and an Offset line. A
# similar effect as above could have been achieved like this:
#
# Offset	0x0892	UINT16	6	rw	$Mags1 >Mags1 @
# Command	0x0892	UINT16	0	4	sim/starters/engage_starter_1
# Dataref	Mags1	sim/cockpit/engine/ignition_on[0]	intarray
#
#
# Expression evaluation
#
# Conversion expressions are written in postfix notation, aka Reverse Polish
# Notation, or RPN, which means operators follow their operands. For example,
# the expression (1 + 2) / 3, in the usual infix notation with operators
# between their operands, is written as 1 2 + 3 / in RPN. If you think of this
# as "remember 1; remember 2; pop the the last two numbers from your memory, add
# them, and remember the result; remember 3; pop the last two numbers from your
# memory, divide the second to last one by the last one, and remember the
# result; when done, the final result is what remains in your memory", it might
# make sense. If not, more information can be found on Wikipedia, as well as
# with your favorite search engine. Numbers, operators and datarefs are
# separated by white space, as in the example above. The following operators
# are supported:
#
# Binary operators:
# + - * /	The usual arithmetic operators
# \			Integer division
# ^			Exponentiation (raise the first operand to the power of the second)
# %			Modulo (the remainder of an integer division)
# & |		Bitwise AND, OR
# == !=		Equal, not equal
# < > <= >=	The usual comparison operators.
#
# The comparison and equality operators return 1 for 'true' and 0 for 'false'.
#
# Unary operators:
# abs		Return the absolute value
# round		Round the operand to the nearest integer
#
# Constants:
# PI		
#
# Ternary operator:
# ?			This operator uses three operands. If the first operand is non-zero,
#			it returns the second operand. If the first operand is zero, it
#			returns the third operand. It can be used to implement simple
#			if-then-else logic, like this: '$data 128 <= 0 255 ?' means 'if
#			$data <= 128 then return 0 else return 255'.
#			
#
# Note there's no unary '-'. Negative numbers are supported, but there must
# be no whitespace between the sign and the digits. If you need unary '-' for
# anything else, write '-1 *' instead.
#
# Datarefs are referred to by their identifier. To read a value from dataref
# and use it in the expression, prefix it's identifier with a dollar sign ($).
# To write the result of the sub-expression that follows to a dataref, prefix
# it's identifier with a greater-than sign (>).
#
# Conversion expressions consist of several sub-expressions, according to the
# offset's access mode: Everything up to the first dataref identifier with
# a > prefix, if any, is considered the read expression, which is evaluated when
# a value is read from this offset. The remainder, if any, is interpreted as one
# or more write expressions, each of which starts with the identifier of the
# dataref to write to, with a > prefix. When an offset is written to, each write
# expression is evaluated in turn, and the results are written to the datarefs
# they follow. That is, the syntax is:
#
# read_expression >dataref1 write_expression_1 >dataref2 write_expression_2 [...]
#
# Note that this backwards from the postfix notation: The result of
# write_expression_1 is stored in dataref1, not in dataref2 as one might
# expect. In write expressions, the special token @, which can appear any number
# of times, is replaced by the value that has been written to the offset.
#
# If anything goes wrong during expression evaluation, one of the following
# values are returned:
#
# 77	Access violation (write access to a read-only dataref, or vice versa)
# 88	Unbalanced formula (After evaluation, exactly one value has to remain
#		on the stack - the final result. If you have too many or too few
#		operators for the number of operands, you get this error.)
# 99	Stack overflow (more than 256 values on the stack)
# 111	Dataref not found
# 222	Stack underflow (not enough values on the stack for this operator)

# Light switches
# This is a good example for a more complex offset. All the light switches
# are combined into one offset in MSFS. The first bit represents the nav lights,
# the second bit is the beacons, etc. For read access, all the datarefs are
# multiplied by the corresponding bit's value, and added up. For write access,
# for each dataref the value written to the offset (@) is taken modulo 64
# (because the higher bits have no representation is X-Plane), the corresponding
# bit is separated out by a bitwise AND, and the result is divided by that bit's
# value to make sure the result is not greater than 1. Bit no 7 (value 64),
# which collectively represents all instrument lights, is used to switch a
# couple of different datarefs all at once. Notice how each line but the last
# ends with an underscore, the line continuation character. Also notice that
# the order of Offset and Dataref commands doesn't matter.

# DME speed strings
# This is a four-character string in FS. Since strings are not supported,
# we have to revert to a little hack and fill in each digit individually,
# pretending the offset is made up of 4 individual UINT8 (i.e. one byte) numbers.
# 48 is the ASCII code for the character '0', with the other numbers following
# in their numerical order. So adding 48 to a digit value effectively converts
# it to ASCII, which is what we need here. The same idea can be used to copy
# X-Plane strings, which are usually data arrays, to string offsets, character
# after character, but of course that quickly becomes tedious for all but the
# shortest strings.

# Audio panel (X-Plane >= 9.40)
# Before 9.40, the audio panel buttons in X-Plane were mutually exclusive,
# while in FS they aren't. To map this correctly, you would need to split
# this offset into COM, NAV, DME and marker parts, and then detect state
# changes within the COM and NAV portions. In other words, if e.g. Nav1 is
# already selected, and the Adf1 button is pressed, you need to make sure
# that Nav1 deactivates and Adf1 activates, not the other way round. And vice
# versa. This is probably just a tiny bit too complex to compute here, and would
# be better implemented in a little plugin publishing a custom dataref that
# could then be used here without further ado:
